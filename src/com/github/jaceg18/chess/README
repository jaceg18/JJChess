Hello! This is my initial draft of a chess engine from scratch in Java.

I enjoy Chess, so I wanted to see what I could do with it programmatically, and as it turns out, I made a formidable opponent (sometimes).

If you lose to your own chess bot, should you be happy or sad? I totally couldn't answer this question.

This project has lots of work before completion, mainly evaluation, hashing, transpositions, minimax, and multi-threading functionality tweaks. As well as improvements in the GUI and a addition of an opening book.

As of now, this bot performs around 1600 elo at a depth of 6.
